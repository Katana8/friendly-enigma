<h1 class ="large">About me</h1>
</p>
<p>I’m a lawyer with a passion for tech.  I have worked at the UK’s top City law firms and one of the UK’s most successful independent games studios.  Combining these two strange bedfellows is what I love to do. </p>
<br>
<p>I have worked on epoch defining legal cases such as Enron and Barings Bank - the then most document-heavy case in British legal history. </p>
<br>
<p>Following the Leveson Enquiry into phone hacking, I helped to establish Impress, the UK’s first Royal Charter compliant, independent press regulator.  I designed the algorithms and end-to-end complaints-handling process and operational procedures, used to process complaints made by the public about the press.</p>  
<br>
<p>I have a strong interest in media law and how the UK might regulate the Internet and the press whilst maintaining a free and independent Internet, protecting our rights to freedom of speech and protecting our rights to privacy.</p>
<br>
<p>In my current role, I am working at West End law firm handling phone hacking claims. Most of these involve celebrities (and those associated with them), who had their phones hacked by the Mirror Group Newspapers and the now defunct News Of The World newspapers, going back to the 1990s.</p>
<br>
<p>As someone who is a staunch activist for human rights, particularly in relation to freedom of speech and the right to privacy, it’s really important to me that we find the right balance between being able to say whatever we think and respecting the individual’s right to privacy.  If this extremely fine balance is not achieved, we, like many other countries, will end up with a state controlled press and an Internet that is full of absolute nonsense.  The Internet needs to have a little bit of nonsense, but people need to know what they are reading is nonsense. We need the press and the Internet to remain completely independent as this is fundamental to democracy.</p>
<br>
<p>I love: cats, robots, gaming, bonsai trees, Zumba, origami and yoga.</p> 
<br>
<p>I am fascinated by: physics, AI, great apes and introverts</p>
