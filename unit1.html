    <h2>1.1 Describing the purpose of IT in modern business</h2>
    </p>

    <p>IT has a variety of purposes in modern business.  Here are a few examples:
    <br>
    <br>
    Communications:  It enables businesses to connect to other businesses, customers and services.  This means a small business can have a global market presence and customer base.  Business is no longer geographically restricted like it once was.
    <br>
    <br>
    Access to Information: Information of all kinds is right at our fingertips.  We can access information that is held by others really quickly and easily, we can retrieve small amounts of information from vast pools of information and we can share information with others really easily and quickly.  This allows many people, who are geographically very distanced to be able to work on single projects together in real time.
    <br>
    <br>
    Automation:  Business is significantly streamlined by to automation
    <br>
    <br>
    We are currently in the midst of a global pandemic.  If it weren’t for applications like Zoom, many businesses would have been unable to keep afloat and would have collapsed.
    </p>
</p>

<br>
<p>
    <h2>1.2 Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully – what do you need to make projects successful? What tools? What skills?</h2>

    <p>Digital projects often involve teams of people with different skills coming together to do something.  Firstly, having properly defined objectives is absolutely critical as this will be the foundation of everything else that follows on thereafter.  Once these objectives have been correctly defined, choosing the right tools, technologies and resources for the project becomes a lot more straightforward.  Effective project management is also crucial to making a digital project successful.</p>
    
   <p>Whether working as part of a team or as an individual, everyone needs access to information.  This makes the Internet essential to whatever you are trying to achieve.  Many of the tools and resources needed will be available freely online.  </p>
    
    <p>Digital projects typically need project management to ensure that people stay focused on the tasks at hand, so that hiccups can be more easily identified and smoothed out and so that teams can ensure they deliver on time.  There is an astonishing amount of project management methodology, software and philosophy available because people have so many different ways of working.  Many digital projects rely on Trello and Kanban methods for managing tasks and workflow because they are considered to be agile.  Slack is a popular messaging app that allows people to upload and share code and files with other users.</p>
    <p>There is a lot of choice when it comes to text editors.  What is best for a particular project is really a matter of personal choice.  A popular text editor is Microsoft’s Visual Studio Code.</p>
    
    <p>GitHub is a great resource for creating and using repositories and there are many online storage solutions available such as Google Drive, Amazon and Dropbox.  These are invaluable for saving, storing and exchanging files, securely online.</p>
    
    <p>Most projects will need to create text documents, spreadsheets and presentations.  There are many options including Google Docs and Zoho.  One of the benefits of using Google is that it is connected to your Google Drive, if you have set one up.  This enables all your documents to be saved automatically into your Drive. </p>
    
    <p>A successful digital project is likely to require a broad and diverse range of skills, particularly for large teams.  A project will require methods to communicate project management tools, storage solutions, document and file production methods and applications and a variety of project-related skills to complete the task at hand.  Project management is essential as is the ability to accurately find relevant information quickly.</p>
    
    <p>Depending on the type of project, having good marketing, social media and branding might also be crucial.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
   <h2> 1.3 Plan and carry out tasks using IT – e.g. making your website. How will you plan it? Include a link to your Trello board.</h2>

    <p>I will be planning my work using Trello.  Trello is a web-based application that is used for list making in the Kanban style.  It allows users to set out tasks on multiple boards that can be view on a single page, such as To-do, Doing and Done.  Dates and deadlines can be added to individual tasks and reminders can be set to each or all.  Coloured labels many also be assigned to each task.  https://trello.com/b/7h93Gg20/html-css-project</p>

<p>
    <h2>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects – what causes digital projects to fail? Why?</h2>

<p>Proper and effective planning and a lack of appropriate skills will inevitably make a digital project fail.  Similarly, projects that fail to make use of the appropriate tools, methods and resources that a specific project requires will also set it up to fail. Having excellent communications is also essential.</p>

<p>Digital technology is by definition fundamentally fast and bleeding edge.  It is hugely competitive and by its very nature, innovative.  There is no capacity for people to be slow, to miss deadlines and to produce poor or shoddy work, when so many other teams will be making great use of all the free resources available to everyone and easily producing great results and then being able to deliver them on time too </p>

<p>Digital projects tend to fail due to poor communication, inadequate or ineffective management, scope-creep (the  project’s scope expands), ill-defined objectives and badly managed expectations.</p>
<br>
<p>According to Enginess Team<sup>1</sup>, there are 5 main reasons why digital projects fail:
  <br>
  <br>
1. Failing to account for business processes
<br>
2. Failing to secure all executive buy-in
<br>
3. Investing in shiny objects, not customer value
<br>
4. Poor definition/expectations setting
<br>
5. Poor vendor selection

    <h2>1.5 Describe how you would go about selecting and using IT systems and software – how do you select the right kind of technology for the job?</h2>

    <p>Selecting the right tech for the job requires proper research.  Fundamentally, having properly defined objectives is essential to performing this task effectively.  I would also talk to experts and colleagues for opinions and info too.  The available budget is key to this decision but there are a lot of free resources online so I would have a good look around first.</p>
    
    <p>Personally, I’m a prolific list-maker, so Trello has always been a favourite of mine.  I use a variety of messaging apps, depending on the context.  For example, I manage several very large Discord servers, which is a messaging application for gaming.  On a recent digital project we used Slack.  At other companies we used WhatsApp and Google Hangouts.  Sometimes what you use is predetermined by what other people are already using but it is ALWAYS worth trying to persuade people to switch to better applications and systems wherever they exist.</p>
    
    <p>Whilst Discord is a great communication app for gamers, Slack is a more appropriate app for digital work projects. This is because it has built in functionality that is better suited to this purpose. For example, uploading code is really easy in Slack, so too is uploading and downloading files. Finding the right IT systems and software therefore requires you to have a very clear understanding of precisely what tasks you need to perform and how your team prefers to carry them out so that you can match your needs to the right tech solutions.</p>
    
</p>
<br>
<br>
    <h2>1.6 Describe and provide analysis on how your chosen technologies have helped you achieve your outcomes. – How has Trello helped you plan and how can git and GitHub help with your codes version control</h2>
<p>For this project, I used: Trello, Visual Studio Code and an online flow-diagram producer. </p> 

    <p>Trello was an excellent way of helping to plan for the project in a way that I was comfortable with, and which suited my working style.  I tend to make a lot of lists and Trello is perfect for this.  Trello allows you to set reminders; to see what you have completed, are doing and have yet to start; and it presents a very clear overview of all your tasks out. </p>
    
    <p>Visual Studio Code is a robust text editor that I enjoyed using. It has a lot of good features built into it and there are lots of extras that can be added on to the application such as extensions and addons.  I benefitted from being able to use the dual pane feature on VS-Code, which allows one to view the CSS tab and HTML tab on the same screen, side-by-side.</p>
    
    <p>Slack has been a really helpful communication application that I have really enjoyed using.  It has the additional benefits of being well-suited to sharing code and to exchanging and sharing files.</p>
    
    <p>Git and GitHub’s ability to control different versions of code would be a great way of being able to restore to an earlier version if for example, you encounter serious bugs or similar problems during testing.  If you accidentally lose all your code, having a recent version to return to would be a great help.</p>
    </p>
<br>
<br>
    <p>

</p>

<p>
<h2>1.7 Describe legal guidelines and constraints that impact digital projects – How does GDPR impact digital projects?</h2>

<p>As well as the laws on GDPR, many businesses have their own internal policies and regulations on matters such as information security. <a href="https://www.ico.org.uk">The Information Commissioner's Office</a> website is a great resource for guidance and information pertaining to data protection and privacy. This is a very complex and rapidly evolving area of law that cannot be summarised in a single paragraph.</p>
<p>However, GDPR sets out 7 principles:
    <br>
    <br>
    1.  Lawfulness, fairness and transparency
    <br>
    2.  Purpose limitation
    <br>
    3.  Data minimisation
    <br>
    4.  Accuracy
    <br>
    5.  Storage limitation
    <br>
    6.  Integrity and confidentiality (security)
    <br>
    7.  Accountability
    </p>

<p>    GDPR governs online activities in many ways. One example of this is the way in which websites are no longer allowed to add cookies to a user's computer without the user's express agreement.</p>
<p>It is critical for Digital Projects to be GDPR compliant. This will often involve having a working plan for what to do if you are hacked and you will need to act very quickly to report this to the ICO immediately after it has happened as part of a damage limitation exercise. This will help to reduce or completely eliminate any hefty fines being imposed for failing to respond to a data breach.</p>
   <p>Businesses need to be mindful of Data Protection law, Health and Safety law, Computer Misuse laws, Equality law (in respect of accessibility, particularly in relation to public bodies and governmental organisations), Copyright infringement, Misuse of Private Information (such as where information is deliberately or negligently leaked by an employee), Defamation and Libel. Failure to comply with GDPR, Health and Safety, Computer Misuse and Equality laws are criminal offences whilst the misuse of private information and defamation are civil wrongs. If you are found to be in breach of these, it is possible that you will be ordered to pay increasingly substantial sums in damages.</p>

<h1>Unit 1, Outcome 2</h1>
<br>
<h2>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used? E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
</h2>

<p>To make my website, I used Visual Studio Code, Internet browsers, Trello, Slack and a word processor.  I have been very happy using Trello as my task manager and Visual Studio Code as my text editor.  I think these apps are very fit for purpose and have a great range of functions.  
    <p>The only change of approach that I made was to incorporate the use of a word processor to type out the answers to my coursework questions, as it is much easier to work from that, than it is typing answers straight into VS-Code.  I then copied and pasted my final answers into VS-Code once they were ready,  I preferred working this way because I find it easier to read and also easier to see which questions remained outstanding.  It also seemed prudent to have a copy of my answers that was stored outside of VS-Code, which I used as a backup file.</p>

<br>
<h2>2.2 Describe whether the IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Trello
</h2>
<p>Visual Studio Code, Trello, Slack and a word processor were very appropriate for the task at hand.  
    <p>Although Visual Studio Code works fine for typing text straight into, I personally find it easier to concentrate and focus better when using a word processor.  A word processor is easier to work from as it has a white background and less visual clutter than Visual Studio Code.</p>  
    <p>Trello is an appropriate tool for task management, whether working independently or as part of a team.  It allows you to add new tasks to a list and check them off as being completed when they are finished. It is suitable for most types of project.</p>
</p>
<br>
<h2>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website? Why? Why not? You should review it on the website itself in the interests of openness. What would you change?
</h2>
<p>I am aiming to produce a project that has full and proper answers to the questions that we were asked, and I want my website to be very clean, uncluttered and minimal in appearance. I want the text to be easy to read and the reading experience to be within a calm environment that is well suited to this activity.</p>  

    Whilst the website looks very plain, I have thought it out quite carefully.  For example, I wanted a light or white background with grey text and orange links and headings.  I wanted this theme to run consistently across the site.  I felt that adding pictures would detract away from the ‘clean-feel’ of this theme.  Although the background looks white, it isn’t.  I chose a muted grey background, that would remove the glare of having a pure white background, whilst retaining a clean and fresh feel.  I have stuck to using a single colour-theme throughout the website and I think this works well.</p>
    <p>I have added and configured a Flexbox navigation bar to each of my webpages.  I have adhered to the single orange accents colour theme.  The navigation bar has an orange background with white text and I think it works very well with my pages. I have also added padding to each of my pages, which has given my text a more easy-to-read look.  I think the padding also makes my webpages look tidier.
    </p>
    I am pleased with my answers and my website.  However, there is a lot more that I intend to do to improve the website.  I anticipate adding new features to the website if I have enough time after completing my questions, or perhaps even after the course has finished.  I simply have not had enough time to complete all the work that I would like to do, to get the website looking exactly how I want. </p>
    
    I would like to showcase my Python coursework (and will do this if I have enough time).  I would like to make the line-spacing between the text to be wider, so the text as a whole is a lot less cluttered and is thereby easier to read.  Some or all of these things I will do if I have enough time at the end of my project.  I am a perfectionist and therefore, I expect there will be a multitude of things that I will keep tweaking until I feel 100% happy with the website.  I decided to focus more of my time in answering the questions on a basic website as I thought this was preferable over having a more cosmetically attractive website with incomplete answers to the questions.  Nevertheless, I am still very pleased with how the webpages look, and I like how simple and clean they are to look at.
</p>
    </p>
<br>
<h2>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project
</h2>
<p>I would like to ensure that the website is fully compliant with as many accessibility features as possible.  I would also expand the space between the text to make it easier to read.  Having a minimalistic website that is visually and aesthetically pleasing is what I am aiming for so spacing out the text and improving the layout should go a long way towards that.  I would like to use the website for work and so presenting it professionally is also highly desirable.
</p>
<br>
<h2>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose
</h2>
<p>I have reviewed outcomes laid out in the cn-htmlcss-proj-unit1 and 2.pdf documents and ensured they match requirements and are fit for purpose.  </p>

    For example, 1.2 Plan and create your website.
    <br>
    I planned my website to be clean and simple in appearance.  I wanted it to be an uncluttered way in which to read the questions and answers to the coursework.</p>
    
    1.3 Selecting and using web site features and structure 
    <br>
    I have structured my website to display over multiple pages: A landing page, About Me, Unit 1 and Unit 2.  I also plan to embed my Python coursework into an additional page, if there is enough time.</p>
    
    I have formatted my answers so they are structured into paragraphs and used 3 different heading types.  I have imported a new font that is used throughout the site.  Links are formatted to all be orange and headings 1 and 2 are also coloured in the same shade of orange.  Heading 3 is formatted into the same grey colour that I have formatted my main paragraph font in.  In addition, I have used superscript for my sources and included bulleted lists.</p>
    </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<h1>Unit 1, Outcome 3
<br>
<br>
</h1>
<h2>3.1 Review the benefits and drawbacks of IT tools and systems used in terms of productivity and efficiency – could you have been more efficient when making your website? How? Could you have done it in teams?
</h2>
<p>The way in which we work is as individual as we are, hence the abundance of task manager software that is available.  Some people prefer to work with pen and paper, and others might prefer to use Gantt charts and sophisticated software.  The tools that I might select to use for a project might not be the most suitable for the rest of my team, if they have a different working style to me.  If a particular application is selected for a whole team to use, then it is important that the whole team makes good use of it, otherwise for example, if people are not checking off their tasks as being completed when they are, how is the project manager supposed to know what work is and is not done, if the information she is reading is not updated?
</p>
<p>In order for people to make proper use of the tools and technology they are expected to use, it is worthwhile ensuring that everyone is sufficiently trained in how to use them appropriately.  This can save a lot of time and avoid making errors.  Training can be expensive and time-consuming, particularly if you waste time and money training people who already know how to use these technologies.  The way in which people learn is also extremely individual.
</p>
<p>Creating an open and honest environment in which people feel comfortable about speaking up when mistakes are made and also when improvements have been identified is really important.  Establishing a work place culture like this can take a lot of time and investment but the rewards are worth it.
</p>
<p>IT tools and systems have proven themselves to be invaluable during the Covid lockdown.  They have enabled people to communicate, share files and information and work in a very normal way, even though many have been working from home.
</p>
<p>We have had very little time in which to complete this project and therefore it was critical that we maximised out productivity and efficiency.  Proper and effective planning has been crucial to this end and I feel that I have achieved this.
</p>
<p>Completing this task as a team would not, in my opinion, been a productive task.  Completing this task as a team would have required an inordinate amount of planning that we simply did not have time for.  For example, a team would have had to agree on all the wording to each and every answer, which would have been extremely time-consuming.  Similarly, ensuring the website theme was consistent throughout the website would have also required complete agreement and extensive discussions and planning to achieve this goal.  While completing this task as a team is likely to have produced better long-term outcomes, it would not have been achievable in the time frame that we were given to complete the task.  I therefore consider it was imperative to complete this project individually.
</p>
<br>
<h2>
    3.2 Describe ways to improve productivity and efficiency
</h2>
<p>Ways in which to improve productivity and efficiency include a variety of different methods and techniques, such ensuring a calm working environment, which will assist in avoiding unnecessary stress.  Having regular breaks and stretching is critical to help both concentration and improve health.  Relaxation and meditation can also be of great benefit, so taking time out to do gentle exercises like yoga can really help body and mind.  Staying hydrated is necessary to good health but getting up out of your seat to stretch your legs whilst you are making a drink is also beneficial to clearing your head and making you more productive.  
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>3.3 Develop solutions to improve own productivity using IT in digital projects – what would you do differently next time? Team work? Use of Slack?
</h2>
<p>I was disappointed that I did not have sufficient time to participate in the yoga class this week as I am a great fan of yoga and find that it is immensely beneficial.  I would definitely ensure that I had sufficient time to factor a session in next time. 
</p>
<p>I find that having regular breaks and stretches really helps me to return to my work more focused, even if this is simply to fetch myself a drink.  I suffer from migraines, so it is really important for me personally, to have regular breaks during which I am able to look away from my screen.  I have purchased tiny little webcam covers that slide across my web cam so that I can open and close it easily.  I occasionally close the slide on my webcam so I can stand up and look away from my monitor for a minute or two, and this helps my migraines a little.  This is helpful because people know I am still at my desk because my webcam remains on, but I am able to move away from my monitor for a minute, without people seeing me doing my stretches and so on.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2>3.4 Describe how you would go about testing digital solutions
</h2>
<p>I have been quite methodical in all my testing and have tested my code after each change incorporated.  Although this might be a little more time consuming, it has meant that I have not had situations whereby I am unable to find errors in a swamp-full of code.  This method has made my testing and error-fixes really easy to remedy.  I have asked two different people to test my website, one of whom was my instructor.  Testing is essential to ensure that everything works as expected.  My tests have consisted of reloading the web pages after each change and ensuring that all the links are working properly.  I have also ensured that my text is consistently laid out with a single uniform theme, throughout the website.
</p>Which types of test one carries out and how they should be done depends entirely on what is being tested.  The above testing has been sufficient for website testing.  However, it would have been necessary to ensure that web pages are optimised for different devices and different screen sizes.  What looks good on a 13 inch MacBook may look almost unreadable on some mobile devices.  There are many types of devices besides computers and mobile phones that are capable of reading webpages,  Making sure the pages display correctly on the full spectrum of devices and screen sizes is really important but probably beyond the scope of this course.
