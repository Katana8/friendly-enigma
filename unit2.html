    </p>
    <p>The content of each of my webpages has consisted of headings, questions and answers to the coursework.  I have also added links to each of the other pages on my website.  There is an additional page entitled ‘About Me’, which contains information about my work.

        <h2>1.5 Describing copyright and other constraints affecting websites</h2>
<p>
    <h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Copyright protects your work and stops others from using it without your permission.</p>
<p>You get copyright protection automatically - you don’t have to apply or pay a fee. There isn’t a register of copyright works in the UK.</p>
<p>You automatically get copyright protection when you create:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Original literary, dramatic, musical and artistic work, including illustration and photography</li>
<br>
<li>Original non-literary written work, such as software, web content and databases</li>
<br>
<li>Sound and music recordings</li>
<br>
<li>Film and television recordings</li>
<br>
<li>Broadcasts</li>
<br>
<li>The layout of published editions of written, dramatic and musical works</li>
<br>
</ul>
<p>You can mark your work with the copyright symbol (©), your name and the year of creation. Whether you mark the work or not doesn’t affect the level of protection you have.</p>
<br>


<p>
    <h3>How copyright protects your work</h3>
</p>
<p>
    Copyright prevents people from:
    <br>
    <br>
    <ul>
    <li>Copying your work</li>
    <br>
   <li>Distributing copies of it, whether free of charge or for sale</li>
    <br>
    <li>Renting or lending copies of your work</li>
    <br>
    <li>Performing, showing or playing your work in public</li>
    <br>
    <li>Making an adaptation of your work</li>
    <br>
    <li>Putting it on the internet</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <br>
    </p>

<p>
    <h3>Copyright overseas</h3>
    </p>

<p>    Your work could be protected by copyright in other countries through international agreements, for example the Berne Convention.
In most countries copyright lasts a minimum of life plus 50 years for most types of written, dramatic and artistic works, and at least 25 years for photographs. It can be different for other types of work.</p>
</p>
<br>

<p>
    <h3>License and sell your copyright</h3>
    </p>
<p>You can license the use of your work if you own the copyright. You can also decide how your work is used.</p>
<p>You can register your work with a licensing body, for example a collecting society, who will agree licences with users for you and collect royalties for you.</p>
<br>
<p>

    <h3>Sell or transfer your copyright</h3>
    </p>
<p>   You’ll need to write and sign a document (sometimes called an ‘assignment’) to show a sale or transfer has taken place.</p>
<p>Your copyright can be transferred by inheritance and will be valid as long as the work remains in copyright - check how long protection lasts.</p>
<br>

<p>
    <h3>Moral rights</h3>
</p>
<p>You can keep or waive your ‘moral rights’, which include the right to:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Be identified as the author of your work</li>
<br>
<li>Object to how the work is presented, for example if you think it’s ‘derogatory’ or damaging to you or your reputation</li>
<br>
<li>Object to changes made to your work</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>

<p><h3>Performers’ rights</h3>
    </p>
<p>You have rights in your performances separate to copyright if you’re a performer.</p>
<p>For example, if you’re an actor in a play you may have ‘economic rights’ in any recordings or broadcasts of their performance, even if the copyright is sold.</p>

    <h2>1.6 Describing access issues that need taking into account - describe issues that people with disabilities may face when using webpages and how we can overcome them.</h2>
</p>
<p>Under the Equality Act 2010 and the regulations that came into force on 23 September 2018, all public sector websites or mobile apps must:
<br>
<ul>
<li>Meet accessibility standards</li>
<br>
<li>Publish an accessibility statement</li>
</ul>
</p>
<br>
<p>There is guidance on how to do this <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/make-your-website-or-app-accessible-and-publish-an-accessibility-statement">here</a>
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The law sets higher standards and requirements for public sector websites.  However, it is in the interests of any website owner for their website to be as accessible to as many people as possible, and to this end, the following list contains several issues to bear in mind.</p>

<p>
    <ul>
<p>
<li>Visually impaired users may wish to use screen readers.  There are many types of screenreader and it is important to make a site as compatible with as many of these as possible.</li>
<br>
<li>Use clear and easy-to-read type fonts</li>
<br>
<li>You may wish to have a high contrast version of the page</li>
<br>
<li>You may wish to use colour-schemes that are useable by those who are colour blind</li>
<br>
<li>Avoid using flashing lights to protect people with photosensitive types of epilepsy</li>
<br><li>Ensure that the website can make use of text-to-speech services where possible</li>
    </ul>
</p>
